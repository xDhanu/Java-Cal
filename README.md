Calculator 1.0.1
Java AWT Calculator Program Description:

This Java AWT program is a simple, functional calculator application that leverages the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) to create its graphical user interface (GUI). The program is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations and provide an intuitive, user-friendly experience.

Features:

GUI Components: The calculator interface includes essential AWT components such as frames, buttons, text fields, and panels to present the calculator's layout.
Arithmetic Operations: Supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Event Handling: Implements action listeners to handle button clicks and perform corresponding arithmetic calculations.
Layout Management: Utilizes AWT's layout managers, such as GridLayout, to arrange the buttons and display screen in a neat, grid-like structure.
Error Handling: Includes basic error handling for operations like division by zero and invalid input.
Custom Design: The design can be easily customized and extended with additional functionalities or improved aesthetics.
How it Works:

The main frame (Frame) serves as the window for the calculator.
A text field (TextField) displays the current input and results.
Buttons (Button) represent digits (0-9), arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, 2x/), and control commands (e.g., equals, clear).
Action listeners are attached to each button to define the calculator's behavior when buttons are pressed.
The layout manager (GridLayout) arranges the buttons and text field in a structured format, ensuring a clean and organized appearance.
This program provides a foundational example of building a practical application using Java AWT, demonstrating the integration of GUI components, event handling, and layout management.
